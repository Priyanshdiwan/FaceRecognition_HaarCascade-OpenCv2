# FaceRecognition_HaarCascade-OpenCv2
Hey!This is a ML program which is a real-time multiple faces recogniser & uses Cv2, Haar features and a pre-trained Cascade classifier!<br><br>
Have a loolk at the following optimaizations:
1. Have train data of Pictures of the person who is to be recognised:<br>
  1.1 Run "capturing_image.py" it would create a folder of "mage_dir" and save your photos<br><br>
 2. Run "Cascade_recog.py"<br>
  2.1 Increase the size(line2) to 3-4, it would increase speed & frame rate but reduces accuracy!<br>
  2.2 Higher the Prediction lower the accuracy i.e 0 is the perfect match!
  
  
  Enjoy!
